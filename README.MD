How to use the app? It's simple!

Look for a listing you like. You can narrow down the search by filtering the results how you want them.
Once you've done that,  click on a listing you find attractive, check the details and contact the buyer if you like so.

The webapp allows users to create an account, post a listing and contact the buyer(in dev).

Classifieds ADS webapp built using the MERN stack. 

The webapp has build in custom components, such as the sidebar menu which can be re-used in multiple scenarios but still performs one function.

I've used React Context API instead of Redux, although I believe Contex API haven't matured enough to replace Redux, yet. So will be adding Redux to the project in the upcoming days.

## Contributing
If you're interested in collaborating, perhaps you want to develop a new feature to gain more experience, or help me out, feel free to make a pull request. 

Bare in mind, if you do so make a pull request, please do so in the `dev` branch, as `master` is connected into automatic deployment, therefore everything would need to be checked before it gets deployed.

Happy coding! :)
