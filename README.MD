How to use the app? It's simple!

Look for a listing you like. Use the sidebar to narrow down the search by filtering the values to your liking.
Once you've done that, click 'Save' at the bottom of the sidebar. New results will be loaded.
Click on a listing you find attractive to view more details.
Ccreate a new account to contact with the seller. 

Make a deal and BAM! The item is yours.

The webapp allows users to create an account, post a listing and contact the buyer(in dev). 

Classifieds ADS webapp built using the MERN stack. 

The webapp has build in custom components, such as the sidebar menu which can be re-used in multiple scenarios but still performs one function.

I've used React Context API instead of Redux, although I believe Contex API haven't matured enough to replace Redux, yet. So will be adding Redux to the project in the upcoming days.

## Contributing
If you're interested in collaborating, perhaps you want to develop a new feature to gain more experience, or help me out, feel free to make a pull request. 

Bare in mind, if you do so make a pull request, please do so in the `dev` branch, as `master` is connected into automatic deployment, therefore everything would need to be checked before it gets deployed.

Happy coding! :)
